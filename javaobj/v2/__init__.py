Rewritten version of the un-marshalling process of javaobj.

This package is based on the approach of the jdeserialize project (in Java)
See: https://github.com/frohoff/jdeserialize

The object transformer concept of javaobj has been adapted to work with this

This package should handle more files than before, in read-only mode.
The writing mode should be handled by the "classic" javaobj code.
